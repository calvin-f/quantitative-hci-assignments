## Lessons Learned

### Raw Data

* One lesson learned is definitely to add more explanation/text to all code. It is important to clearly explain every step undertaken and to add notes to each step and result. 
* Furthermore, testing assumptions is an important part of the analysis. 

***

* Just include charts that bring value to the workbook. 
* Document what and why you are doing some calculations and visualizations

*** 

* The setup of additional packages is well handled and brings good reproducibility
```
# define additional packages
additional_packages <- c("multcomp", "PearsonDS", "ARTool", "qqplotr", "psych", "moments")

# only install additional packages when they are not already included
install.packages(setdiff(additional_packages, rownames(installed.packages())))  
```

* The notebook makes good use of the R markdown features with marking text as code or using inline R code

* First of, we define a helper function `read_log_files` that will help read in all the different log files.

* Our data set contains `ncol(data)` columns (*`colnames(data)`*) and `r nrow(data)` rows for `n_distinct(data$user_id)` different users.

### Top three

* Documentation
* Make good use of `*.rmd` capabilities.
  * Inline code
  * Auto imports/installation of required packages
*
